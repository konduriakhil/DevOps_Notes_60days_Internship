# What is meant by algorithm in k8s?
**In Kubernetes, an algorithm refers to the rules or procedures used to make decisions and perform tasks.** It's a fundamental concept that underlies many of the core features of Kubernetes, such as:

**1. Scheduling:**

* Kubernetes uses scheduling algorithms to determine which nodes to place pods on based on various factors like resource availability, affinity rules, and taints and tolerations.
* Popular scheduling algorithms include:
    - **Default scheduler:** The built-in scheduler that considers factors like CPU, memory, and node labels.
    - **Fairness scheduler:** Prioritizes pods based on their fairness requirements.
    - **Priority scheduler:** Prioritizes pods based on their assigned priorities.

**2. Load Balancing:**

* Kubernetes uses load balancing algorithms to distribute traffic across multiple pods within a service.
* Common load balancing algorithms include:
    - **Round Robin:** Distributes traffic evenly across pods.
    - **Random:** Selects pods randomly.
    - **Least Connections:** Selects the pod with the fewest active connections.

**3. Resource Management:**

* Kubernetes uses algorithms to manage resource allocation and usage, such as CPU, memory, and storage.
* Resource allocation algorithms aim to optimize resource utilization and prevent resource contention.

**4. Pod Eviction:**

* Kubernetes uses eviction algorithms to decide when to evict pods from nodes due to resource constraints or other reasons.
* Eviction algorithms help to ensure that the cluster remains stable and performs optimally.

**5. Garbage Collection:**

* Kubernetes uses garbage collection algorithms to clean up unused resources, such as pods, services, and deployments.
* Garbage collection helps to prevent resource leaks and improve cluster performance.

**Understanding these algorithms is essential for effectively using Kubernetes and optimizing your cluster's performance and resource utilization.**
