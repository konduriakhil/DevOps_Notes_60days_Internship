# What is the difference between Storage, Database, Data?
  **Storage**, **database**, and **data** are interconnected concepts, but each has a distinct role in computer systems:
  
  **Storage:**
  
  * **Physical space:** Storage refers to the physical devices used to store data, such as hard drives, solid-state drives (SSDs), and cloud storage.
  * **No inherent structure:** Storage devices don't have a predefined structure for organizing data.
  * **Direct access:** Data is accessed directly by the operating system or applications.
  
  **Database:**
  
  * **Structured data:** Databases organize data into tables, rows, and columns, with defined relationships.
  * **Efficient access:** Databases use indexing and query optimization to quickly find and retrieve data.
  * **Managed:** Database management systems (DBMS) are used to create, maintain, and access databases.
  * **Typically stored on storage:** Databases often store their data on underlying storage devices.

    **Data:**

    * **Information:** Data is the raw information that is processed and stored. It can be in various forms, such as text, numbers, images, audio, or video.
    * **Stored in storage:** Data is typically stored on storage devices.
    * **Used by databases:** Databases organize and manage data for efficient retrieval and use.

    **In summary:**

    * **Storage** is the physical space where data is stored.
    * **Database** is a structured collection of data that is organized for efficient access and management.
    * **Data** is the raw information that is stored in storage and used by databases.

    **Think of it like this:** Storage is the warehouse where you keep your belongings, a database is a library where those belongings are organized and cataloged, and data is the actual information contained in the belongings.

## Shell
**The `cp` command is a built-in shell command that is executed by the shell interpreter (e.g., Bash). The shell is responsible for understanding and carrying out the `cp` command.**

Here's how the system knows to copy the file:

1. **Command Parsing:** When you enter `cp love.txt ~/live`, the shell parses the command, breaking it down into individual parts:
- `cp`: The command name, indicating the operation to be performed.
- `love.txt`: The source file to be copied.
- `~/live`: The destination directory where the file will be copied.
2. **Command Execution:** The shell then looks for the `cp` command in the system's path. If found, it executes the command, passing the source and destination paths as arguments.
3. **Internal Implementation:** The `cp` command is implemented as a system call, which is a function that allows a program to interact with the operating system's kernel. The kernel is responsible for handling the actual file copying process.
4. **File System Operations:** The kernel performs the following steps:
- Locates the source file based on the specified path.
- Opens the source file for reading.
- Reads the contents of the source file.
- Locates the destination directory and creates a new file with the same name as the source file.
- Opens the destination file for writing.
- Writes the contents of the source file to the destination file.
- Closes both files.

**In essence, the shell interprets the `cp` command and passes it to the kernel, which handles the actual file copying operation.** The kernel uses its knowledge of the file system and system resources to perform the necessary steps to copy the file.

# linux file system hierarchy

The Linux file system is organized in a hierarchical structure, similar to a tree. The root directory, denoted by `/`, is at the top of the hierarchy, and all other files and directories are located beneath it. 

Here's a breakdown of the common directories in a typical Linux file system:

### Root Directory (`/`)
* **The top-level directory.**
* Contains the most important system directories.

### `/bin`
* **Binary executables:** Contains essential commands and utilities.

### `/boot`
* **Boot loader files:** Contains files used by the boot loader to start the system.

### `/etc`
* **Configuration files:** Contains configuration files for various system services and applications.

### `/home`
* **User home directories:** Contains the home directories for individual users.

### `/lib`
* **Libraries:** Contains shared libraries used by applications.

### `/media`
* **Mount points for removable media:** Used to mount external devices like USB drives or CDs.

### `/mnt`
* **Temporary mount points:** A temporary mount point for filesystems.

### `/opt`
* **Optional packages:** Contains additional software packages installed by the user.

### `/srv`
* **Service data:** Contains data for services running on the system.

### `/tmp`
* **Temporary files:** A temporary directory for storing temporary files.

### `/usr`
* **User programs and data:** Contains user programs, libraries, and documentation.

### `/var`
* **Variable data:** Contains variable data, such as logs, temporary files, and mail.

**Example of a typical Linux file system hierarchy:**

```
/
├── bin
├── boot
├── etc
├── home
│   └── user1
│       ├── Documents
│       └── Downloads
├── lib
├── media
├── mnt
├── opt
├── srv
├── tmp
├── usr
│   ├── bin
│   ├── lib
│   ├── local
│   ├── share
│   └── sbin
└── var
    ├── log
    ├── mail
    └── tmp
```

This is a simplified view of the Linux file system hierarchy. The actual structure may vary slightly depending on the specific Linux distribution and installed packages.
### What is the difference between /media and /mnt
**`/mnt` and `/media`** are two directories in Linux that are primarily used for mounting external storage devices, such as USB drives, hard drives, and network shares.

### `/mnt`
* **Purpose:** This directory is a general-purpose mount point for various external storage devices. It's a convenient location to temporarily mount devices for data access or transfer.
* **Usage:** When you connect an external device, you can typically use a command like `mount` to attach it to a specific directory within `/mnt`. For example, to mount a USB drive at `/mnt/usb`, you might use the command:
   ```bash
   mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
   ```

### `/media`
* **Purpose:** This directory is specifically designed for automatically mounting removable media devices. It is often used by desktop environments and file managers to provide a user-friendly way to access external storage.
* **Usage:** When you connect a USB drive or other removable device, your system may automatically mount it to a subdirectory within `/media`. The exact subdirectory name might vary depending on the device's label or unique identifier. For example, it could be mounted as `/media/usb_drive` or `/media/volume1`.

**In summary:**

* Both `/mnt` and `/media` serve as mount points for external storage devices.
* `/mnt` is a general-purpose directory for manually mounting devices.
* `/media` is often used by desktop environments for automatically mounting removable media.

The choice of which directory to use depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you prefer manual control over the mounting process, `/mnt` might be more suitable. If you want automatic mounting and a user-friendly interface, `/media` is a good option.
