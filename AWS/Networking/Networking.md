# OSI Model In Networking
## What is meant by OSI networking model?
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that describes how information is transmitted between computers in a network. It divides the communication process into seven layers, each responsible for a specific task. 

Here's a breakdown of the OSI layers:

1. **Physical Layer:**
   * Deals with the physical transmission of data bits over a physical medium (like cables, fiber optics, or wireless).
   * Handles issues like bit encoding, signal modulation, and physical connectors.

2. **Data Link Layer:**
   * Responsible for framing data bits into data packets and ensuring reliable transmission across a physical link.
   * Handles error detection, correction, and flow control.

3. **Network Layer:**
   * Responsible for routing data packets across the network.
   * Handles logical addressing (IP addresses) and packet switching.

4. **Transport Layer:**
   * Provides reliable end-to-end communication between applications.
   * Handles issues like segmentation, reassembly, flow control, and error checking.

5. **Session Layer:**
   * Establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications.
   * Handles synchronization and checkpointing.

6. **Presentation Layer:**
   * Responsible for data formatting, encryption, and compression.
   * Ensures that data is presented in a suitable format for the application.

7. **Application Layer:**
   * The top layer that interacts directly with the user or application.
   * Handles specific network applications and services, such as HTTP, FTP, and email.

The OSI model is a conceptual framework, and not all protocols or implementations strictly adhere to it. However, it provides a valuable reference for understanding network communication and the roles of different network components.
## In physical layer how communication is transmitted in underlay
In the physical layer of the OSI model, communication is transmitted in **underlay** mode by using **physical media** to carry the data. This involves converting digital data into electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signals that can be transmitted over the physical medium.

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Encoding:** Digital data is converted into a suitable format for transmission over the physical medium. This involves encoding the data bits into electrical signals (for copper cables), light pulses (for fiber optics), or radio waves (for wireless).
2. **Modulation:** The encoded data is modulated onto a carrier signal, which is a continuous wave that can be transmitted over the physical medium. Modulation techniques like amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or phase modulation (PM) are used to encode the data onto the carrier signal.
3. **Transmission:** The modulated carrier signal is transmitted over the physical medium. This can be done through various methods, such as:
   - Copper cables: The electrical signal is transmitted through copper wires.
   - Fiber optics: Light pulses are transmitted through optical fibers.
   - Wireless: Radio waves are transmitted through the air.
4. **Demodulation:** At the receiving end, the received signal is demodulated to extract the original data. This involves separating the data from the carrier signal.
5. **Decoding:** The extracted data is decoded to convert it back into its original digital format.

**Key points about underlay transmission in the physical layer:**

* It involves the physical transmission of data bits over a physical medium.
* It uses encoding and modulation techniques to convert digital data into a suitable format for transmission.
* It can be done through various methods, such as copper cables, fiber optics, or wireless.
* It requires demodulation and decoding at the receiving end to recover the original data.

**In summary, underlay transmission in the physical layer is the process of physically carrying data bits over a physical medium using electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signals.**

## Are these layers helpfull to one another?
**Yes, the layers of the OSI model are interconnected and interdependent.** Each layer builds upon the services provided by the layer below it and provides services to the layer above it. This hierarchical structure helps to simplify the design and implementation of network protocols and applications.

Here's a breakdown of how the layers interact:

* **Physical Layer to Data Link Layer:** The physical layer provides the raw transmission medium for the data link layer. The data link layer frames data bits into packets and handles error detection and correction, relying on the physical layer for reliable transmission.
* **Data Link Layer to Network Layer:** The data link layer provides reliable transmission of data packets across a physical link. The network layer uses this service to route packets across the network and handle logical addressing.
* **Network Layer to Transport Layer:** The network layer provides a service for routing packets between different network nodes. The transport layer uses this service to establish end-to-end connections between applications and ensure reliable delivery of data.
* **Transport Layer to Session Layer:** The transport layer provides reliable communication between applications. The session layer uses this service to establish, manage, and terminate communication sessions.
* **Session Layer to Presentation Layer:** The session layer provides a framework for communication sessions. The presentation layer uses this framework to format data, encrypt it, and ensure that it is presented in a suitable format for the application.
* **Presentation Layer to Application Layer:** The presentation layer handles data formatting and encryption. The application layer uses this service to interact with the network and exchange data with other applications.

In summary, the layers of the OSI model work together in a coordinated manner to enable effective communication between computers in a network. Each layer provides services to the layer above it, and relies on the services provided by the layer below it. This interdependence ensures that the entire communication process functions smoothly.
